# How to run the server & client
## Server
### Docker (recommended)
The repository builds & publishes master branch to a docker image. To use this server you'll have to simply run a container with the image that we publish.

Here's a quick set-up through **docker compose**. It sets up alicia server instance running on default ports and binds important folders to folders in the working directory of the docker compose.
```yaml
services:
 instance:
   image: 'ghcr.io/story-of-alicia/alicia-server:latest'
   restart: unless-stopped
   ports:
     - '10030-10033:10030-10033/tcp'
   ulimits:
     core: -1
   volumes:
      # If you bind `/alicia-server/config` to host filesystem, the default configuration
      # will be unavailable, and you have to manually to get it from the `/resources`
      # folder in the repository.
      #
      #- "./config:/var/lib/alicia-server/config"
      # 
      - "./logs:/var/lib/alicia-server/logs"
      - "./data:/var/lib/alicia-server/data"
      - "./dumps:/dumps"
```

#### Server configuration
By default, the game uses ports `10030`-`10033`. The default configuration of the server should be sufficient for development purposes.

On the server there is two categories of configurations, one for the general server settings and one for the game settings, located at `./config/server` and `./config/game` respectively.

#### Authentication

The server requires an authentication service to authenticate user credentials. Currently, the server supports `local` and `postgres` backends. Local does no verification at all, while Postgres uses a table in a specified database. Todo documentation. Ask in Studio server. 

## Client
### Client
[You can download the production game version installer from here](https://drive.proton.me/urls/37WM215Q1R#NlzxAZSg7VFC) ([gdrive mirror](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NMh_Y8UsTB4HgfR5qVP81ko-ukKSA_00/view)). Game contains some required patches (see Patches section).

The installation contains launcher and the game itself. The default installation directory is `%appdata%/Story of Alicia`. 

### Game configuration
There's three available game configurations in the production version:
- **development** (ID: `2`)
  - lobby server address: `aliciadev`
  - lobby server port: `10030`
- **prototype** (ID: `3`)
  - lobby server address: `prototype.storyofalicia.com`
  - lobby server port: `10030`
- **production** (ID: `4`)
  - lobby server address: `system.storyofalicia.com`
  - lobby server port: `10030`

Development configuration is meant for connecting to a server that is hosted locally. Please notice the development configuration uses `aliciadev` hostname. You must add this hostname to your hosts file (`C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`) on the computer you're running the client on, and point it to an IP where the server is listening on. Usually that is going to be `127.0.0.1` (loopback).

Prototype configuration is meant for connecting to the online prototype. Currently hosted by @Chrommd, more information available at the [prototype's website](https://bruhvrum.github.io/registertest/).

Production configuration is meant for connecting to the officialy released server. Not available yet.

### Launching game in development configuration

Locate the game executable file. If the installer was used, this is usually `%appdata%\Story of Alicia\game` unless explicitly changed. If different path was used in the installer, you can consult the `HKCU\Software\Story Of Alicia\Default` registry key as it points to the location where the game was installed.

Open terminal in the game folder and run the following command:
```bash
./Alicia.exe -GameID 2 -ID [username] -OP [password]
```
